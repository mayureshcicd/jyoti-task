uppose my Spring Boot service is receiving a large number of payment requests from multiple Spring Boot pods.

The issue is:

One pod may receive a payment transaction for account ID 100, amount 1000.

At the same time, another pod may also receive a payment transaction for the same account ID 100, amount 1000.

In this case, there is a chance of a deadlock or race condition.

What I want is:

If a payment request for the same account ID is already being processed, then any subsequent transactions for that same account ID (coming from different pods) should be put on hold until the first one finishes.


so how to solve this issue  in java in spring boot, where i am getting lot of requests from different   or same pod

Question to  AI :---can i use  java.collection using HashSet ???


Answer from AI :---

Ah, I see! You want to use HashSet from Java Collections for locking. However, this approach won't work in a distributed environment with multiple pods, and here's why:

Why HashSet Won't Work for Distributed Locking
Not Thread-Safe: HashSet is not thread-safe for concurrent access

Local to JVM: Each pod has its own JVM, so HashSet instances are not shared between pods

No Distributed Coordination: HashSet doesn't provide distributed locking capabilities


Problems with this approach:

Only works within a single JVM (single pod)

Other pods have no visibility into this HashSet

No fault tolerance - if the pod crashes, locks are never released

No distributed coordination


Recommendation
For your multi-pod Spring Boot application, I recommend either:

Database advisory locks (simplest, no extra infrastructure)

Redis distributed locking (fast, good performance)

Database pessimistic locking (most reliable, transactional)

HashSet and other Java Collections simply cannot provide distributed locking across multiple pods.

Question :-- can i  create new  microservice  it will be in center base microservice  and there i can write logic  of locking
this micro service  will inform me that the account is in use or not if it is in used, it will hold for next call but  

i want to use application level lock using any java collection feature.
